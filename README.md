# Image Hunt

Image Hunt is a project I created to practice using NextJS, TailwindCSS, and the Unsplash API. In this project, you can search for images and download them, as well as view information about the image and the author.
I used modals based in routes, Intercepting Routes allows you to load a route from another part of your application within the current layout.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create and configure a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```bash
KEY_UNPLASH=YOUR_KEY
```

 Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
